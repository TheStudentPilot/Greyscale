>*Groan* Creeeek -cue suspensful music- You don't know where you are, but you have a feeling it is bad. All you remember is going to sleep last night at 8:00. Everything seemed fine, or so you thought. Now, you have night vision goggles strapped to your head, a cell phone, and three AA batteries. You look at your phone, and you find stats, things that haven't been invented yet! You can see your health, your night vision and energy percentage, and so many other things!

>Okay. Get it together. This is just a dream, a very bad dream. Pinch yourself. Ow! No, no this isn't a dream. Okay, let's use common sense. Limited batteries, better save them. Who knows what's here! *Beep Beep* Text message? "Don't run out of night visio". Hm. Better take that advice. Okay, let's start exploring. - Greyscale Entrance Scene
